# K-means Cluttering with Quantum Annealing Applied to Electoral Redistricting



## Introduction



## Motivation/Goals for the Project

Gerrymandering is the practice of redrawing geopolitical district boundaries to give an unfair advantage to a political party in elections. 

Our goal was to use the well-known method of k-means clustering and D-Waveâ€™s Leap hybrid solver to prevent gerrymandering practices. Using population information from census data over the counties of a state, we are able to suggest best practices for districting in elections. 

We wanted to take quantum computing and demonstrate its applicability in topics that affect not just scientists and engineers, but the general public. 



## Description of the Work




## Proposals for Future Work

* Create a website/front-end interface for users to interact with the data
* Code a function that automates the collection of the geographic data
* Include more factors that may come into play with a realistic setting, i.e. more current geopolitical data, socioeconomic status, education, etc.

Other applications:
* We can apply our k-means clustering algorithm in fields of potent research interest, including solid state/condensed matter physics, etc, but we have demonstrated the ability to include statistical data for usage in economics, political science, etc.
