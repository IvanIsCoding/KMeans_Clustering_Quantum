# K-means Cluttering with Quantum Annealing Applied to Electoral Redistricting

## Introduction

## Motivation/Goals for the Project

## Description of the Work

## Proposals for Future Work

* Create a website/front-end interface for users to interact with the data
* Code a function that automates the collection of the geographic data
* Include more factors that may come into play with a realistic setting, i.e. more current geopolitical data, socioeconomic status, education, etc.

Other applications:
* We can apply our k-means clustering algorithm in fields of potent research interest, including solid state/condensed matter physics, etc, but we have demonstrated the ability to include statistical data for usage in economics, political science, etc.
